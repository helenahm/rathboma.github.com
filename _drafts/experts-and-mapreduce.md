title: 5 Industry Veterens Talk About Their Favorite MapReduce Frameworks
---

Over the last 2 years I've published [numberous MapReduce framework guides][1], but I've given no real direction on *which* framework to use and why.

If you're just getting started with Hadoop and MapReduce I know figuring out where to start can be very overwhelming, so getting direction is important!

I figured instead of flapping my own opinions (which are outdated honestly), I'd reach out to folks who are writing production code every day and ask them what they use. So here we go.

## Questions

1. Which MapReduce Framework do you prefer to work in?
2. Why do you like using it vs regular MapReduce?
3. Why do you like using it vs other MapReduce frameworks?
