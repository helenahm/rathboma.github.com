I'm happy to announce a new product recently released to the Google Play Store - [Wi-Fi Check-In][app].

[Wi-Fi Check-In][app] is an Android app to let you check-in to foursquare automatically when you connect to a wi-fi network. There are a bunch of customization features, so check out [the product page][app] for more information.

## A Quick Walkthrough

Setting a configuration is really simple:

- Click add to create a new mapping
