Version 2.0 of [Simple Check-in][1] is now in the Google Play store.

This release adds a long-press function to venues that allows you to add a shout/comment to your check-in, and optionally choose to share your check-in with facebook and twitter.

You should see the application update trickle through in the next few hours.

Here is a screenshot to prove it:
