I'm currently researching the problems that organizations face with their data warehousing and Hadoop deployments. 

Do you have a data warehouse? 

Do you use Hadoop for data analysis and reporting? 

Do you think this infrastructure offers you the best return on investment?

I want to help organizations make the most of their analytics and reporting infrastructure, but to do that I need your help. I've started a quick survey to collect information on how these tools are used, and the problems with them. 

If you have two minutes, your input would be very valuable. I will happily share the outcome of the survey with you if you are interested.
