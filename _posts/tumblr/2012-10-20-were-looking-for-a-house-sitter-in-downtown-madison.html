<p>We have a nice 2bed apartment in downtown madison, and we&#8217;re looking for someone to house-sit for us for a couple of weeks in late December / early January (exact weeks unsure).Â </p>
<p>Not only would you get the use of our DVR, 42&#8221; TV, 20mb internet, office and balcony, but <strong>we&#8217;ll pay you</strong> too! All we ask is that you feed our cat, and keep her company (she loves people).</p>
<p>Leave a comment, or tweet me (<a href="http://twitter.com/rathboma">@rathboma</a>) if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
