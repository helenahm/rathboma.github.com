<p>I&#8217;m a long-time fan of <a title="puzzles" target="_blank" href="http://themastertheorem.com">The Master Theorem</a>. The puzzle-master (M) posts pretty difficult to solve puzzles on a weekly basis, but lately something interesting has happened, user submitted puzzles have started being posted.</p>
<p>Is it just me, or does this look like the start of a really interesting (and self-regulating) community for puzzle fanatics (makers AND solvers)?</p>
<p>I hope so!</p>
