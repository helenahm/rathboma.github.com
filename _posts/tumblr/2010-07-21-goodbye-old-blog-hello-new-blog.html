title: Goodbye old blog, hello new blog
subject: personal
---
<p>I&#8217;m finally saying goodbye to the old matthewrathbone.com/blog .</p>
<p>I built the site back in 2008 using ASP.NET (which I was working with at the time) and its become a total pain to maintain, update, and style. It is with that in mind that I have moved my blog to <a href="http://tumblr.com">http://tumblr.com</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;ll be importing my old posts into this new blogging system, perhaps I will import the popular / important posts about the bloomberg API and algorithms, but I&#8217;m not promising anything.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy this better site, and please checkout my most recent project: <a title="couponize.me" target="_blank" href="http://couponize.me"><a href="http://couponize.me">http://couponize.me</a></a></p>
