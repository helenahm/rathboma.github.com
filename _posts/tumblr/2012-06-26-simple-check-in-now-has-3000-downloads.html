<p>Simple check-in is my 3-second check-in app for foursquare. I released the app <a href="http://blog.matthewrathbone.com/2012/04/14/one-touch-check-ins-for-foursquare.html">on April 14th</a>, so that&#8217;s an average of 40 installs per day (I&#8217;m actually seeing about 50-60 per-day at the moment, so this average is slowly increasing).</p>
<p>I guess <a href="http://blog.matthewrathbone.com/post/21324266876/so-im-a-spammer-now">being labelled as a spammer for a week</a> didn&#8217;t hurt me too much after all :-).</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who has downloaded my app so far. To those who haven&#8217;t, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matthewrathbone.simplecheckin">get it here on the android market</a>.</p>
