title: Adding scaladocs to a Scala function in Sublime Text 2

<p>I&#8217;m trying to comment my code more often. Specifically, I&#8217;m trying to add useful comments more often. In many cases this requires documenting a function using a scaladoc comment, but I can never remember the syntax, so I created a sublime-text-2 snippet.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/3989343">Here it is on github</a></p>
<p>To install: Tools -&gt; Create Snippet -&gt; [paste in the gist] -&gt; save as something.sublime-snippet.</p>
<p>Now:</p>
<p><strong>just type &#8216;docs&#8217; and press tab. Hey presto! Instant documentation.</strong></p>
<p>Enjoy. (I&#8217;m sure this already exists, but creating a snippet was a learning exercise too!)</p>
