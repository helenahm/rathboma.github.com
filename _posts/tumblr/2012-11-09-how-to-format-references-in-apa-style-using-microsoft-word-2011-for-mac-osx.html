<p>If you write a lot of academic papers in the social sciences (like my wife does) you&#8217;re likely going to have to manually format some references at one time or another. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like my wife, you&#8217;ll likely start inserting tabs and newlines all over the place, but then if you ever have to edit your references you&#8217;ll end up with a mess you&#8217;ll have to fix manually, which can be frustrating.</p>
<p>Seeing as I&#8217;m usually the dogs-body who ends up fixing APA reference formatting on an almost weekly basis, I thought I&#8217;d document it so maybe my wife will learn how (hint hint).</p>
<p>So here is my guide:</p>
<p><strong>1) Get the basics in order.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Authors are listed Surname, Initials: &#8220;Rathbone, M.A.&#8221;. Comma separate multiple authors.</li>
<li>Then you put the year of the paper in parens (1994)</li>
<li>Then the title of the paper. Not every word is capitalized: &#8220;How to format references&#8221;</li>
<li>Then the journal in Italics &#8220;<em>Harvard Educational Review</em>&#8221;</li>
<li>Then the issue, and the page number.</li>
</ul><p>Here&#8217;s the complete example:</p>
<p>Rathbone, M.A. (1994). How to format references. <em>Harvard Educational Review, </em>33(1) 1-20.</p>
<p><strong>2) Tricky line formatting stuff</strong></p>
<p>APA requires that all lines other than the first be &#8216;hanging&#8217;, that means indenting them by 1/2 inch. And unlike the rest of your paper they should be single spaced.</p>
<p>Do NOT add tabs to do this, there&#8217;s a better way:</p>
<p>A) Select all your references by dragging over them with your mouse.</p>
<p>B) Navigate to Format -&gt; Paragraph</p>
<p>C) In indentation, select Hanging</p>

<p>D) In Spacing ensure line-spacing is &#8216;Single&#8217;, and enter &#8216;16pt&#8217; in the field labelled &#8216;after&#8217;. This is the amount of space to leave between paragraph blocks. Click ok.</p>
<p>E) Set your font to Times New Roman, size 12.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! Your references should be in good shape.</p>
<p><span><strong>Bonus tip:</strong></span></p>
<p>You&#8217;ll likely add / remove references in the process of editing, so it&#8217;s best to save the reference style for quick application in the future. Thankfully this is pretty easy:</p>
<p>select a reference that you just formatted by dragging over it with your mouse</p>
<p>Go to Format -&gt; Style</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/img/tumblr_md8x1zcSR81qar0o4.png"/></p>
<p>Now select &#8216;New&#8217;</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/img/tumblr_md8x30NAJT1qar0o4.png"/></p>
<p>The selection will default to the format of the text you have selected (your reference), which is correct. Name this something like &#8216;APA Reference&#8217;, ensuring &#8216;Add to Quick style list&#8217; is also selected, and click ok.</p>
<p>Now you can select unformatted references and simply select the style from the Home Ribbon:</p>

<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>One Last Thing</strong></p>
