title: Game Programming in Scala with Libgdx and Box2D
subject: programming
---
<p>I&#8217;m learning the ropes of <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a>Â and box2d, a cross-platform java game framework and physics engine. However, I code with Scala all day, and I wasn&#8217;t quite ready to go back to Java-land quite yet.</p>
<p>So I figured while I was finding my way around libgdx (and game development in general), it might help other scala programmers if some scala examples were posted online as a reference. SBT project setup is a bit of a pain for libgdx + android, so hopefully an example of that might help someone at the least.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rathboma/scala-libgdx-examples" target="_blank">Check out the repo on github.</a></p>
<p>The first example I&#8217;be built is a box2d player-control scheme, <a href="http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress/?p=2017">originally built by Mario on the Badlogic games blog</a>. Screenshot below (running scala!).</p>

<p>The goal is to teach myself different components of the framework one piece at a time, and to post these examples to the repo. Next up I&#8217;m going to mess around with sprite animation and tilemaps.</p>
