<p>I just clicked publish on &#8216;GeoPop&#8217;, my first Android project.</p>
<p>GeoPop is a puzzle game where you have to pop geometric shapes as fast as possible before the timer runs out. It gets pretty frantic pretty quickly, so you need to have quick fingers to reach that elusive high-score :-).</p>

<p>PS - I would really appreciate any feedback, so please <a href="http://twitter.com/rathboma">tweet me</a> with anything at all, even to just tell me why it sucks!</p>
