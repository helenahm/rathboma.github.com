title: Do you spend hours formatting word documents?
subject: office
---
<p>My wife does, which basically means that I end up formatting all of her documents for her, because it takes me about 1/10 of the time.</p>
<p>Given enough time I can probably verbalize how to do this, but I have no idea if this would be of wider interest.</p>
<p>So, if you spend hours formatting word documents, and you&#8217;d like it to only take 5 minutes, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDdOa3NLemhYaTQ2YWc3a1l0NFlaSGc6MQ#gid=0" target="_blank">let me know here</a>, and I might be persuaded to make a little ebook about it.</p>
