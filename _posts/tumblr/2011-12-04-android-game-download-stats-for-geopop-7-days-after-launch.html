<p>I&#8217;ve always found download statistics articles by other app developers extremely interesting and useful when trying to get insight into download and revenue rates for mobile applications. I thought I&#8217;d share the love with some stats on my <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.rathboma.geopop" target="_blank">very first android game GeoPop</a>.</p>
<p><span><strong>GeoPop</strong></span></p>
<p>The game is very simple: tap shapes in the order specified as fast as you can within the time limit. The more shapes you match, the higher your score will be. The challenge comes from beating your own high-score and placing top of theÂ leader-board.</p>
<p>The simplicity of the game mechanic was ideal for learning android development, and the mechanics of game development in general. Being a server-side developer by trade, it was a big leap having to work with UI vs game threads and handling time based animation, rendering and object movement in a frame rate independent way.</p>
<p>Equally, because the mechanic is fairly simple, and the game has only a single game mode, my expectations as to download numbers are very conservative.</p>
<p><span><strong>Stats</strong></span></p>
<p>I released the game on November 26th.</p>
<p>Today (December 4th). I have a total of <span>183 installs.</span></p>
<p>Here is my google analytics chart for the number of app launches per day:</p>
<p><img src="/img/tumblr_lvp2q3H2do1qar0o4.png"/></p>
<p>This represents a total of 108 absolute unique users.</p>
<p>My total revenue from admob so far is $0.06, so any dreams of a <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t9oBaOX5ZA8/TaIhMq0GXYI/AAAAAAAAVc8/6RHY05hfAvg/s1600/scrooge_mcduck.jpg" target="_blank">giant money vault</a> are still a long way from fruition.</p>
<p><span><strong>Take Away</strong></span></p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy at my 180 downloads so far, its more than I expected (0) from my first android project.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I released a bug-fix on December 3rd along with a new application icon, and this increased both downloads and active sessions drastically (about 70 downloads happened on that day). The same was not true for a bug fix released 2 days after launch.</p>
<p>Hope this is interesting to the internetz in the same way other posts were useful to me.</p>
