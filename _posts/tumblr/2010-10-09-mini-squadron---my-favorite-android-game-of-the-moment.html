<p>I&#8217;ve been hunting for some good android games recently and this is one of my favorites. Put simply you have to kill all the other planes using your one weapon. It sounds simple, but you can get a range of different weapons, about 100 planes, and lots of different levels (which get quite challenging). In addition, the animation and artwork is lovely and really makes it fun to play.</p>
