<p>Last weekend I found myself drawing Christmas characters, so to capitalize on the idea I built a game:</p>
<p>Santa Says? is a simon-says style memory game where the goal is to repeat the pattern shown to you on screen. It gets really hard (my highscore is 19), and it&#8217;s really fun.</p>
<p>To go along with the hand-drawn graphics I also added funny voices to each of the characters (it&#8217;s more fun than a *beep* noise!).</p>
