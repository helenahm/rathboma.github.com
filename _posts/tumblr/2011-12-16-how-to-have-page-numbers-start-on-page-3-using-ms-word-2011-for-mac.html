<p>This works if you want your page numbers to start anywhere after page 1. In my example I want to start numbering on page 3, but this would work even if you wanted page numbering to start on page 57 (for example).</p>
<p>We do this by breaking the document into sections. In this example I am using the following structure:</p>
<p>Page 1 - title page</p>
<p>Page 2 - contents page</p>
<p>Page 3 - real document starts <strong>&lt;= I want this to be labelled page 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Insert a section break at the end of the title page, and the end of the contents page.</strong></p>
<p>Put your cursor at the END of your title page, then click Insert =&gt; Break =&gt; Section Break (next page)</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/img/tumblr_lwbdy7Z6uy1qar0o4.png"/></p>
<p>Do the same thing for the contents page. Now your document has 3 sections and when we insert page numbering it will only number that section.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Insert the Page Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Navigate to the first page you want numbered (page 3 in my example).</p>
<p>Click Insert =&gt; Page Numbers</p>
<p>Ensure &#8216;show number on first page&#8217; is checked</p>
<p>Click Format&#8230;</p>
<p>Under &#8216;page numbering&#8217;, select Start At and enter &#8220;1&#8221;</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/img/tumblr_lwbe9opXnO1qar0o4.png"/></p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s it!</strong></p>
<p>You can now update your contents page and it will refer to your shiny new page number format.</p>
<p>This took me a long time to work out. I&#8217;m writing this primarily for my awesome wife who writes way more essays than I do. :-)</p>
<h2>More Help</h2>
<p>Although I don't think it covers this exact scenario, these <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1936220482?tag=matratsblo-20">Microsoft Word reference guides on Amazon</a> are cheap (~$3) and have really helped me learn where all the useful features are without having to google everything.
