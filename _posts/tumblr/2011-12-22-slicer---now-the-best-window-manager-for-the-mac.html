<p>I was always a big fan of the shift-it and size-up window managers for the mac, but they were never quite flexible enough.</p>
<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/slicer/id487999732?mt=12" target="_blank">Enter Slicer</a>. It&#8217;s seriously awesome. You should buy it now because it&#8217;s only $3.99 and it&#8217;s better than competition costing $15.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of my desktop organized by slicer, notice the top two windows are 1/3 and 2/3 width. Awesome:</p>
