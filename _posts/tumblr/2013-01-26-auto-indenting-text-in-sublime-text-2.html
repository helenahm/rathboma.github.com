<p>I only just realized this was a feature, so I&#8217;m excited to share it.</p>
<p>If the indenting is all messed up in a file you are currently editing, you can have Sublime Text 2 try and auto-fix the indenting for you.</p>
<p>Select the text you wish to fix, then:</p>
<p>Edit -&gt; Line -&gt; Reindent</p>
<p>That&#8217;s it! This made me so happy today because I thought I was going to have to do everything by hand (or with bash).</p>
