<p>Sometimes you just want to check-in to foursquare as quickly as possible. Well now you can!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to introduce &#8220;Simple Check-in&#8221;, a one touch check-in app for foursquare. It&#8217;s fast, free, and there are no ads (and never will be).</p>
<p>I built the app because sometimes I want to avoid being rude, or because I&#8217;m checking in somewhere mundane like the supermarket. This app allows me the best of both worlds, I can check-in so fast no-one knows I even did it.</p>
