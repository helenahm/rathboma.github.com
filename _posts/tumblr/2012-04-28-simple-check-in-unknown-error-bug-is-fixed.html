title: Simple Check-in 'Unknown Error' bug is fixed!
subject: android
---
<p>I just pushed a fix to the hated &#8216;unknown error&#8217; bugs that have been plaguing a minority of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matthewrathbone.simplecheckin">Simple Check-in</a> users. This fix is available in versions 1.3 and above.</p>
<p>The error was due to number formatting differences between US and European devices.</p>
<p>For future reference, on many european Locale phones, formatting a string with the double 46.1234 will actually be written out as 46,1234. See the difference? The european formatting uses a comma instead of the US-standard decimal place.</p>
<p>This caused errors when calling the foursquare API as this is not a valid way to represent Lat/Long coordinates.</p>
<p>So if you were frustrated because Simple Check-in wasn&#8217;t working for you then <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.matthewrathbone.simplecheckin">download the new version and give it a try!</a></p>
