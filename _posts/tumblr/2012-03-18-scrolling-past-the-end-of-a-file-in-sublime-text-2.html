title: Scrolling past the end of a file in Sublime Text 2
description: A hidden feature of sublime text 2 that you can't possibly live without.
subject: programming
---
<p>If you hate looking at the bottom of the screen when you&#8217;re editing the last few lines of a file, add this line to your sublime text 2 user settings (Preferences -&gt; Settings - user):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;scroll_past_end&#8221;: true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you&#8217;ll be able to scroll past the end of a file!</p>
<p>Look, now I can edit line 139 in the middle of the screen! Success!</p>
