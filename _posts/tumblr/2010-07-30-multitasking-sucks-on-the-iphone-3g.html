title: Multitasking sucks on the iPhone 3g
subject: personal
---
<p>I have an iPhone 3g (from the UK) and I live in Brooklyn, NY, so to allow me to use it I had to jailbreak it. In doing so I figured, &#8220;Why not enable multitasking?&#8221;. I&#8217;ll tell you why: I did, and its terrible, it makes the phone crawl at a snails pace. Simply loading the sms window takes a whole minute if you have a couple of applications in the &#8216;multitask window&#8217;. If you&#8217;re thinking of jailbreaking your iPhone 3g just to enable multitasking, don&#8217;t bother!</p>
