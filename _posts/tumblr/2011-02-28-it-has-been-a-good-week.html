<p>So over the last week I&#8217;ve been doing some pretty awesome things.</p>
<p>I went to the <a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/22762">Wollman Rink</a> in Central Park to skate with NYR players </p>
<p>I went to the <a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/41046">Metropolitan Opera</a> to watch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armida_(Rossini)">Armida</a> </p>
<p>Then on Saturday I was at <a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/41378">BAM</a> to see Diary of a MadMan (with Geoffrey Rush) </p>
<p>Finally yesterday (Sunday) I went to see the <a href="http://foursquare.com/venue/217085">Rangers play at Madison Square Garden</a> </p>
<p>And tonight I&#8217;m going to the <a href="http://www.universityclubny.org/">University club</a>!</p>

<p>All in all a very good week, although I&#8217;m sure you can guess how much NYU work has been completed.</p>
