# Projects

I'm the organizer of the [Big Data Madison][5] meetup group

I created a campfire bot called [Squarebot][4]

I've made a few small [android apps][1].

A while back I built [remember.me][2] to stop myself forgetting important dates.

Here's a [video-game prototype][3] I built in java during my time at NYU.
